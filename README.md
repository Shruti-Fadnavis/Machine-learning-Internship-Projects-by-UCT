# Upskill-Campus

**Hello Everyone!!** ðŸ˜„ âœ¨
Our team members - Shruti Fadnavis,Sanskrit Gupta,Shrey Gupta and Prasanna Tapkire got an excellent Internship opportunity from Upskill-Campus in the domain DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING.
We are grateful to have this opportunity and we learnt a lot from this internship.
# Crop Production Prediction in India

This repository contains the code and report for the project **"Crop Production Prediction in India"** . The project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the quantity of specific agriculture crop production in India. The objective is to address the challenges faced in agriculture by providing stakeholders with reliable predictions for informed decision-making and resource allocation.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's understanding of agricultural factors.

3. Model Training: Train different machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, on the training data.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

5. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model for crop production prediction.

The project aims to contribute to improved agricultural practices and food security in India by providing valuable insights and predictions to support decision-makers in the agricultural sector.
